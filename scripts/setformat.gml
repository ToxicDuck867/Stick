/*When sending messages over a tcp socket the messages need to be seperated.The dll provides two methods of seperation. Method 0: Binary mode. Setting this mode makes every tcp message have a 2 byteinteger attached at the front which represents the amount of data in that message. This is the default method and is reccomended in online games.Method 1: Text mode. Setting this mode makes every tcp message have a delimeteradded at the end which is used to identify the end of the message. This isreccomended for text based protocols like irc.Method 2: No formatting. Only the data in the internal buffer is sent andno seperation methods are included.Argument0 = socket idArgument1 = method number[Argument2] = seperation string when using method 1.MAKE SURE THE CORRECT FORMAT MODE IS SET WHEN RECIEVING A MESSAGE THAT IS IN ASPECIFIC FORMAT.returns argument0*/return external_call(global._SokG, argument0, argument1, argument2);
